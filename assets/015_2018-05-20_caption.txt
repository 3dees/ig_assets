Spring is finally here and the fishing is getting hot.  Lots of shallow prespawn fish in the last week.  Bedding activity should be underway this coming week.  Here are a few photos of some of the catches this past week on East Bay.  When the winds are right you can find them really bunched up. Grand Traverse Bay never disappoints.
