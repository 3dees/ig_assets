Not a lot of fishing happening right now.  What can a guide do?  Built some new fishing rods.  Thanks to Gary Loomis and Northfork composites.  Doing some boat maintenance, oil, filters, etc.  
Days are getting longer and the snow won't be around much longer! It won't be long now and we can be getting back out there. Looking forward to chasing those beauties on the water. Grand Traverse Bay delivers again!
