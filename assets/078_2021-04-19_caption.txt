Fun Sunday afternoon.  Smallmouth have been showing up in pre-staging locations for the last week or so.  Water temps are 46 to 48F.  Once we get consistent temps above the 50F mark the action will get even better. 
Tubes and blade baits are the preferred tackle right now.  Action was pretty steady. This is Grand Traverse Bay fishing!
